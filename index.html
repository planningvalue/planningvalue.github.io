							<h2>Tell Me More.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I feel like it is frustrating and difficult for a lot of us to design and achieve a financial goal on our own. For one thing, personal finance is <strong>very personal</strong>. It’s difficult to view your situation/expenses/and goals objectively or to even carve out the time to sit down and think about them at all!<br><br>
                            
                            I graduated from MIT with a degree in Brain and Cognitive Science and a concentration in Economics. My educational background got me thinking a lot about why people <strong>behave</strong> the way they do and how we can get a kickstart to tap into our <strong>internal motivation</strong> to reach our own goals. I think it is critical to point out that no financial coach can pick your goals for you, they have to be 100% your own or there’s no chance we’re going to be able to help you succeed.<br><br>

                            I really believe there’s a better way to do this - specifically treating financial goals and action plans like multimillion dollar tech projects and assigning a project manager (aka me, your financial coach!) to help <strong>clarify:</strong><br><br>

                            <ol><li>1. What the goal is.</li>
                                <li>2. What the definition of success is.</li>
                                <li>3. What milestones we’ll hit.</li>/Users/hannahf/Documents/GitHub/planningvalue.github.io/index.html
                                <li>4. How we will track progress.</li>
                                <li>5. How to influence clients to get motivated to put in the <strong>work</strong> (oh yes there will be work!) to make it happen.</li><br><br>
                            
                            I’ve been following this process for years with software engineers, execs, designers and marketers to produce tangible <strong>results</strong>. It is my life’s work to work with people 1:1 to do the same thing for their financial lives.

                            <p class="main">Hi, I'm Hannah (a name that was not as common in the 80s when I got it but now every other person I meet is a Hannah). I am your typical Type A highly organized person. I graduated MIT in 2011 with a degree in Brain and Cognitive Sciences and a concentration in Economics and have been project managing cool stuff at tech companies ever since.<br><br> When I had my now 1 year old daughter I knew I wanted to start growing again. I wanted to make sure when she wants to start her own business someday she'll know it is not scary or unknowable but entirely doable, which is a gift my mother gave to me.<br><br>
                            I started to think how I can apply my day job skills to create a positive force for good in the world and personal finance education has been something I've been passionate about since I was a teenage employee #1 at my mom's company filing paper statements for her financial analyst clients (yes, people used to use paper).

                            Today I like to spend any stolen free moments playing with my little monkey, working out while listening to a podcast or reading a book while curled up on the couch, with the requisite gin and tonic  in hand.<br><br>
                            There are a lot of very approachable, down to earth people in the field of personal finance I like to follow. I'm a particular longtime fan of podcasts Afford Anything, Side Hustle School and HerMoney. Personal finance nerd at heart.</p>
